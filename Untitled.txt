My estimate of the amount of time this project would take was quite off
In completing this assignment I got help from Hewner, Jain, and a little bit from my TA.
I didn't really use any additional resources to complete this assignment.
My impression of this assignment: I liked the assignment. I thought it was cool and that everything was fun to implement. It took me a long time to get started however and I felt lost at times.
